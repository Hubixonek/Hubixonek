I am currently pursuing my studies in Information of technology at Collegium Da Vinci in Pozna≈Ñ. My primary focus is on web development. In my free time I go to the gym, specifically I am interested in the weight training. Also I do enjoy going for the long walks and meeting with friends. 
I am curious about the world and I am doing my best to manage my time well and spend effectively every single day.
